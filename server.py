This project aims to predict mental health conditions using comprehensive survey data and a variety of machine learning models. The purpose is to assist in early identification of mental health concerns, supporting timely and effective intervention strategies.

## Data Preprocessing & Deep Cleaning

We performed an extensive and thoughtful data cleaning and transformation pipeline to prepare the dataset for modeling:
- **Drew Inferences**: Performed EDA to Draw Inferences in order to identify relevant columns
- **Missing Value Handling**: Utilized **KNN Imputer** to fill in missing values in categorical columns and filled missing values in numeric columns with either 0 or by the mean of the column.
- **Encoding**: Applied **one-hot encoding** to multi-class categorical features such as `Gender`, `Sleep Duration` and  `Dietary Habits`.
- **Age Binning**: Created age categories (`Teenagers`, `Young Adults`, `Adults`, `Middle-aged and Older`) while preserving the original age column.
- **Data Type Consistency**: Ensured all columns had consistent and model-friendly data types.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using **StandardScaler** to normalize data.

These cleaning steps significantly enhanced data quality, improved model training, and reduced noise.

## Models Evaluated

We tested a diverse range of machine learning models to find the most accurate and generalizable solution:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **RandomForestClassifier**
- **ExtraTreesClassifier**
- **BaggingClassifier**
- **GradientBoostingClassifier**
- **LinearSVC**
- **SVC**
- **DecisionTreeClassifier**
- **XGBClassifier**
- **GaussianNB**
- **AdaBoostClassifier**
- **LGBMClassifier**
- **CatBoostClassifier**
- **Voting Classifier** (ensemble of: Logistic Regression, CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost)

## Hyperparameter Tuning

The four models in Voting Classifier were fine-tuned using **Optuna** with **5-fold cross-validation**, optimizing primarily for **accuracy**. This allowed for efficient and automated discovery of the best hyperparameters for each model.

## Best Model

After evaluating all models, **CatBoostClassifier** consistently outperformed others and achieved an **Accuracy** of **94%**

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

By combining thoughtful preprocessing with extensive model experimentation and tuning, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively used to predict mental health challenges with high accuracy.
